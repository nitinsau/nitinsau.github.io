	<li><b>18 January 2023:</b> <mark>About the recent progress in the Union-Closed Sets conjecture</mark><br><br>
	  <b>Speaker:</b> Rogers Mathew, IITH.<br><br>
	      <b>Venue and Time:</b> C-LH10, 1200-1300 hrs.<br><br>
	      <b>Abstract:</b> A family of subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} is union-closed if for every two sets in the family their union is also present in the family. A famous conjecture related to union-closed families is Frankl's Union-Closed Sets Conjecture (UCS Conjecture). It states that for every union-closed family F of subsets of {1,2,...,n}, there exists an element e in {1,2,...,n} such that e is present in at least half the number of sets in F. In other words, the UCS conjecture states that there exists an e in {1,2, ...,n} such that |F_e| >= |F|/2, where F_e denotes the collection of sets in F that contain the element e. The best known general result so far on the conjecture is due to [Knill] (Wojcik made a minor improvement to this later) which says that there is an element e which is present in at least 1/log(|F|) fraction of the sets in F.<br><br> 

This talk is based on a very recent paper (see [Gilmer]) that appeared in arxiv which makes significant progress towards resolving the conjecture. The paper proves that there is an element e which is present in at least 1/100 fraction of the sets in F. The emphasis of this talk will be to show an outline of the proof of this result.

	<li><b>11 January 2023:</b> <mark>Karchmer-Wigderson games for Hazard-free Computation</mark><br><br>
	      <b>Speaker:</b> Nitin Saurabh, IITH.<br><br>
		  <b>Venue and Time:</b> C-LH-6, 1545-1700 hrs.<br><br> 
		  <b>Abstract:</b> Hazards are spurious pulses or electronic glitches that may occur on the output of circuits during an input transition. 
It occurs due to physical delays at wires or gates in a specific hardware implementation of the circuit. 
A hazard-free circuit guarantees that no glitches will occur in any hardware implementation of this circuit, regardless of the physical delays.<br><br>

In this talk I will present a game between the two quintessential protagonists in computer science, namely, Alice and Bob. 
We will show that this game captures the complexity of hazard-free computations exactly!  
As an application, we will give exact bounds for computing the Multiplexer function in a hazard-free way.<br><br> 

This talk is based on a joint work with Christian Ikenmeyer (University of Warwick) and Balagopal Komarath (IIT Gandhinagar).
